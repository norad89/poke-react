This is a simple web application made with Create-React-App.

The application itself fetches data from PokéAPI (https://pokeapi.co/), returning a pokémon id number, name and sprite, and allows the user to add the selected pokémon to an array which represents the team.

The application was created in occasion of the lessons about API services attended during the CodeMaster Bootcamp in 2020.

I keep it for sentimental reasons.

To install the app just clone the GitHub repository and run "npm install" in your terminal while on the app root folder.
